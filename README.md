# My favorite series
**1. Series name :** Armored Trooper Votoms <br>
**2. Genre :** military science fiction mecha anime <br>
**3. Plot :** The series is set in the distant future, where two space nations, Gilgamesh and Balarant, have been at war for over a century. The story follows Chirico Cuvie, a former special forces soldier who becomes entangled in a conspiracy involving a mysterious woman and a secret project. The main form of vehicular combat in this universe is the Armored Trooper (AT), a bipedal combat vehicle used extensively in battles.

**4. History and reason for it being my favorite :** As a child, my mom bought me  a bootlegged CD of "Transformers", it turns out that what's inside the CD was a part of this series called "Armored Trooper VOTOMS: Pailsen Files" (released in 2008) which depicts a somewhat **realistic** depiction of mecha warfare compared to other more known mecha series such as Gundam that featured way larger mechas (on average, 18 meters tall) comapared to Armored Troopers (on average, 4 meters tall).

I personally really liked how "gritty" and mature it was at that time, with the main character Chirico Cuvie surviving from pure skills (and an unknown reason that I won't spoil, just in case I have you, the reader interested). Because it was essentially a prequel to the original 1983 anime series, I didn't understand it much as a child but enjoyed seeing badass clunky mechs fighting.

Years after, I ended up watching all the series under the Armored Troopers Votoms universe in chronological order in terms of its timeline in the universe to finally understand what it was all about, and boy was it quite a long watch in this order:

- Roots of Ambition (OVA)
- Pailsen Files (OVA)
- Armored Trooper VOTOMS: Udo Arc (TV Anime)
- The Last Red Shoulder (OVA)
- Armored Trooper VOTOMS: Kumen ~ Quent Arc (TV Anime)
- The Big Battle (OVA)
- Armored Trooper VOTOMS: Epilogue Last Scene (TV Anime)
- Shining Heresy (TV Anime)
- Alone Again (OVA)
- Phantom Chapter (OVA)

- Armor Hunter Mellowlink (spinoff, not really connected to the main story but still great)
